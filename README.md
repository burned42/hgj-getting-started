Hetzner Game Jam Starter Kit
============================

This kit will help you get started.  We want all contributions to be free as in freedom and so you do not need to worry about licensing too much, you can make use of this repo.  We provide information for physical contributions as well as for software contributions.

Please don't forget to also add your game to the list at the [Hetzner Game Jam repo](https://github.com/hetzneronline/game-jam).

Software Contributions
----------------------

For software contributions, you can use this repo as a starting point.  We recommend the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3 or later (AGPLv3+) for software contributions.  If you want to use it, simply follow these steps:

* start a new empty repo
* download the zip version of this repo and unpack it into your new repo (please don't clone it because that would provide the wrong copyright information in the Git history)
* delete everything in this README except the section `Legal Notices`
* add your own information in the README as appropriate
* add this license header to every file

```
/*
 * SPDX-FileCopyrightText: Copyright information recorded in version control history
 *

```

* if the file does not support a header, create an additional file named `filename.extension.license` (like for this `README.md`) and add the same information in that file.
